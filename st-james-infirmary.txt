			 St. James Infirmary - Louis Armstrong
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Am                 E           Am
I went down to the St. James Infirmary
         F    E      E7
I saw my baby there,
        Am             E          Am
she was layed out on a cold white table,
   F        E         Am
so cold, so white, so fair.

CHORUS:

Am                  E       Am
Let her go, let her go, god bless her
         F       E    E7
wherever she may be,
        Am          E          Am
she may search this wide world over,
             F            E        Am
she'll never find a sweet man like me.


Am          E      Am
When I die, bury me,
              F       E     E7
in a high top Stetson hat,
      Am        E         Am
put a 20 dollar goldpiece on my watch chain,
   F           E             Am
so god know I died standing pat.


Am           E                Am
I want 6 crapshooters for pallbearers,
             F         E     E7
chorus gonna sing me a song,
      Am        E            Am
put a jazz band on my hearse wagon,
      F        E      Am
raise hell, as I roll along.


CHORUS

Am            E            Am
Roll out your rubber tired carriage
              F        E      E7
roll out your old time hack,
Am     E            Am
12 men going to the graveyard and,
F  E      Am
11 coming back


Am            E       Am
Now that I've told my story,
                  F       E      E7
I'll take another shot of booze,
       Am            E         Am
and if anyone should happen to ask me,
  F          E         Am
I got those, gambler's blues.

CHORUS
