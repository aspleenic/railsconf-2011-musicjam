A E E A E E 
You say you stand by your man 
A E E A E E 
Tell me something I don't understand 
A F#m 
You said you loved me, and that's a fact 
A E E A E E 
The you left me, said you felt trapped 
A E 
Well, some things you can't explain away 
F#m A 
But the heartache's with me till this day 

A E E 
You didn't stand by me 
A E E 
No, not at all 
A E E 
You didn't stand by me 
A E E 
No way 


All the times when we were close 
I'll remember these things the most 
I see all my dreams come tumblin' down 
I can't be happy without you around 
So alone, I keep the wolves at bay 
And there's only one thing I can say 

[Chorus] 

[Bridge:] 
E C#m F#m A E E A E E 
You must expla-a-a-ain why this must be 
E C#m F#m A E E A E E 
Did you li-i-i-ie when you spoke to me? 
A E E A E E 
Did you stand by me? No, not at all 


Now I got a job, but it don't pay 
I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay 
But without all of these things I can do 
But without your love, I won't make it through 
But you don't understand my point of view 
I suppose there nothing I can do 

[Chorus] 

[Bridge] 

[Intro riff again]
