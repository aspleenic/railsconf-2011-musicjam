GIVE ME ONE REASON TO STAY

Give me one reason to stay here
C         D             G     
And I'll turn right back around
C                                                     
Give me one reason to stay here
D                       G
And I'll turn right back around
D
Because I don't wanna leave you lonely

But you got to make me change my mind

and then just repeat the rythym for the rest of it

Baby, I got your number

And I know that you got mine

But you know that I called you,

I called too many times

You can call me baby,

you can call me anytime

But you got to call me



Give me one reason to stay here

And I'll turn right back around

Give me one reason to stay here

And I'll turn right back around

Because I don't wanna leave you lonely

But you got to make me change my mind



I don't want no one to squeeze me

They might take away my life

I don't want no one to squeeze me

They might take away my life

I just want someone to hold me

And rock me through the night



This youthful heart can love you

And give you what you need

This youthful heart can love you

And give you what you need

But I'm too old to go chasing you around

Wasting my precious energy



Give me one reason to stay here

And I'll turn right back around

Give me one reason to stay here

And I'll turn right back around

Because I don't wanna leave you lonely

But you got to make me change my mind
